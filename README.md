### JS Syntax: Lodash Practice

###### Description:
This challenge project set forth a series of rulesets for possible methods for which I had to abide by. This project emphasized becoming more independent with creating methods.

###### Current issues in development:
The `_.chunk()` method was clunky. I feel like there could have been a more efficient way of producing the same output.
